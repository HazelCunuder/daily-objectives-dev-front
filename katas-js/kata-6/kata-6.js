"use strict"

/*
You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N]. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position 0, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.

Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.

console.log(countBs("BBC"));
// → 2

console.log(countChar("kakkerlak", "k"));
// → 4

function countBs(word) {
    let count = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        if (word[i] === "B") {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

console.log(countBs("BABYBELL"));

function countChar(inputString, targetChar) {
    let num = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < inputString.length; i++) {
        if (inputString[i] === targetChar) {
            num++;
        }
    }
    return num;
}

console.log (countChar("Johnny Test", "n"))
